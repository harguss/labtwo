                Hello! My name is Ian Whitmore. I am 34 years old and live in Iowa City with my wife, son, and our two
                dogs. I graduated from the University of Iowa in 2011 and have previously worked in the banking industry
                and as a real estate agent. I have lived a lot of different places. New York, Texas, California, and
                Iowa. I also like to travel with my family as much as I can. Some of my favorite foods are pizza, wings,
                and a good cheeseburger. I love to play and watch sports and some of my favorites are golf, football,
                basketball, and baseball. I love to listen to all types of music but I especially like reggae. I am
                excited about learning to code and eventually working as a software developer.
            </p>
